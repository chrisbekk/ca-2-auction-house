# Introduction
This is a website called "The Auction House". It was an assignment for Frontend Studies at Noroff December 2023. The website connects to a backend API, and allows for user registration, login functionality with JWT and CRUD.
When you visit the site, you can sign up for an account, or search for items that are up for auction. As a signed in user, you can update your profile picture, create new auction item and bid on other people's listings.

## Technologies used
I decided to use TailwindCSS for this website. I did not have any experience with TailwindCSS, but found it easy to work with, and I prefer it over Bootstrap, as it provides
less abstraction and restrictions on my own code. 

I also used Prettier for clean and consistent code formatting.

Other than that, it is all regular Javascript.

## How to
In order to register, you need to provide a @stud.noroff.no email account. 

In order to deploy site locally, clone this repo and run npm install to install devDependencies.
